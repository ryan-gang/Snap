# snap
Snap is a lightweight downloading tool for documents from snaphomework.com.
It's a CMS tool used by schools, for uploading and sharing documents with students. Often upto 20 documents a day which then have to be individually downloaded and sorted. This tool helps in the downloading part.

Just input the date upto which you wish to download the documents from snap and get started. Teachers also share a few youtube links and a fair number of just other useful links. Which can be found in the project directory.
